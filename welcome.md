My name is Maria clara, i have profound and bilateral deafness. I'm currently an undergraduate in System Analysis and Development. I'm still a beginner at learning about programs. By now, I'm learning Java and Python and having contacts with HTML and Markdown. Therefore, I look forward to learn constantly because I seek evolution in my area.

I'm creating in my GitHub repositories according to what I'm learning in the moment. Click [here](https://github.com/clarameier?tab=repositories) to have acess of my repositories and follow the constant evolution I am acquiring.
